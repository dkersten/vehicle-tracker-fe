### Built With ###

The frontend is built with:
* React
* React Router
* Styled Components for styling

## Roadmap ##

This is a work in progress pet project that I plan to continue to update in the future. However as seeding the data is time consuming it will be a slow process. Some things I'd like to implement in the future:

* Add additional information/stats to vehicles
* Add photos to the vehicles
* Add garages cars can be stored in
* Allow users to add cars to garages so they can keep track of their vehicles
